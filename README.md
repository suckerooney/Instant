Instant

This is an instant messaging app similar to modern day messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc.

This app uses encryption to keep messages secure and has the same functionality as the most used apps such as image, video, and voice messaging. This app incorporates read receipts as well as the ability to hide the read receipts. 

Using Google Firebase for the NoSQL database and Flutter to create the front-end for the app. We have created a fast messenging app that mimicks all that users are used to. 

Soon to be implemented group messeging for users that want to have a chat amongst multiple users.
